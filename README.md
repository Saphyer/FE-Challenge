BusyBus Challenge

The scope of the task is to find a solution to help solve the issue identified by Transit officials at the Washington & State Street bus stop in the form of a visual design for a mobile app called Busy Bus in a single screen:


Due to expansion, numerous bus routes have recently been added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop.

Riders want to know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.

Simply rushing to the stop when you see a bus coming no longer works because it might not be the bus the rider is expecting.
